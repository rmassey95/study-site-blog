# Study Site

The purpose of this app is to highlight notes on important topics covered throughout my programming and web development journey. I have used NextJS to implement this application which pre-renders all the locations on first build to allow for fast and efficient browsing. I am slowly migrating some of my notes, while trying to keep them condense, to this app in the form of markdown. All the notes are saved within the application currently.

## Usage

I have deployed the website using Vercel. You can visit the site at the following URL: https://study-site-blog.vercel.app/
Each note is subdivided by category for easier searching.
